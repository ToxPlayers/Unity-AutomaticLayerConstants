# UnityLayersConstantsGenerator
Automatically generates a static class with all the layers as int constants with their mask.
After setting your layers, click under Tools/Generate Layer Constants
The class won't be generated and compiled if there aren't any changes to the layers.
You can drag the file to any folder and change its location freely, the path will be tracked as long as the name is "Layers.cs".
